        <h3>Problem</h3>  
        <p>Users feel that the Untermyer Gardens Conservancy website is outdated and cluttered, especially in the header section, which makes it difficult to navigate and find relevant information, highlighting a need for a modern, streamlined, and user-friendly redesign.</p>  
        </div> 
        <div class="sidebyside">
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>By Restructuring the Navigation Bar, we figured it would have a high impact on helping lessen confusion for users when trying to find a certain page</p>
<p>Additionally, we decided to increase font size as it would help increase accessibility and improve readability</p>
